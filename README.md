# minesweeper
In this project, you will build the first part of a Minesweeper project that you will come back to and complete later in this unit.  This will bring together all of the skills that you just learned:  You'll practice using the command line to create the file structure. You'll use your text editor (Atom recommended) to write the code for the project. You'll use Node to execute your project code. This lays the foundation for the skills that you need to later make React Apps on your own computer!  Setting up projects on your own computer can be tricky, which is why we've broken this Minesweeper into multiple steps. In this part of the project, you'll get some basic code working, but you'll come back in later weeks to build the more advanced game logic.  Open your terminal and text editor to get started.
